# Rot135

A small tool to apply [ROT13](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) to a given file or STDIN.

It 'encrypts' texts by applying `ROT13` to the characters 'a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z'. no other chacacters will be changed, no
one with diacritics such as 'Å¡', nor symbols or (decimal) digits.

You _can_ use the command option -5 or --five (hyphen five) to transform decimal digits in a similar way. i.e.
transforming using the following table

| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| 0     | 5      |
| 1     | 6      |
| 2     | 7      |
| 3     | 8      |
| 4     | 9      |
| 5     | 0      |
| 6     | 1      |
| 7     | 2      |
| 8     | 3      |
| 9     | 4      |


## Installation

TODO: Replace `UPDATE_WITH_YOUR_GEM_NAME_IMMEDIATELY_AFTER_RELEASE_TO_RUBYGEMS_ORG` with your gem name right after releasing it to RubyGems.org. Please do not do it earlier due to security reasons. Alternatively, replace this section
with instructions to install your gem from git if you don't plan to release to RubyGems.org.

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add rot135

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install rot135

## Usage

`rot135` takes a file name (or STDIN), reads it runs it through ROT13 and outputs the result to STDOUT.

* Use the command line option `-5` or --five` to convert digital digits instead of alphabetical letters.
* Use `-b` or `--both` to apply both transformations.

```bash
> echo 'Hello World!' | rot135

```


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can
also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the
version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version,
push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
